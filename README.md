# Project: Object Detection with YOLOv8 on Raspberry Pi 4

## Overview
This project utilizes YOLOv8 to train a custom object detection model, deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a camera. The model is trained on a local laptop and later transferred to the Raspberry Pi for real-time object detection.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Accessing the Trained Model
- Unzip the `Yolov8_model_train.zip` file to access the trained YOLOv8 model.

### 2. Running the Object Detection on Raspberry Pi
- Download the rest files to your Raspberry Pi:
  - `cam.py`
  - ...
  
  
- To start the object detection using the Raspberry Pi's camera, run the following file:
  
  ```bash
  cam.py

### Result:
